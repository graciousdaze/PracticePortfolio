        <p>
            My current hobbies involve learning and reading, 87% of the time 
            (63% of statistics are made up on the spot). Otherwise music 
            (spent 47 full days worth of listening to music in 2017...thanks Spotifiy for those stats!), and spending an unnecessary copious amount of time laughing at puns.
